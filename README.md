## Exploratory Data Analysis on 911 Calls

### Introduction:

I dug into a dataset of 911 emergency calls, using Python to figure out some interesting insights. My main goal was to spot patterns and connections in things like the reasons behind 911 calls, the times, days, and months when the calls happened the most, and any other cool trends. I wanted to know the peak times for calls each month and year, and basically, understand what's going on with 911 calls. This exploration helps us make better decisions based on the data, especially when it comes to managing emergency services effectively.
  
### Aim of this project:

•	The reason for the 911 Calls<br>

•	Diffrent towns and the frequency of calls from each of them<br>

•	To find which was the day where the most of the 911 calls were placed and what was the reason for that call<br>

•	To find the spikes in months, years and day of the week for different reasons for the call<br>

•	Prime days, hours and months when the crime happened<br>


### Take a look at the dataset sources and my Jupyter Notebook to understand step by step analysis.

### My insights:

•	EMS for the reason for the maximum amount of calls placed<br>

•	Friday, Monday and Tuesday are the days where people placed an emergency calls because of 'EMS' followed by 'Traffic' and then 'Fire'<br>

•	We can say that the year 2018 was the year in which a lot of emergencies took place<br>

•	Friday and Wednesday between 15hour to 17hour lots of emergency calls took place<br>

•	The month of March and Fridays is the prime time for all the calls for emergencies<br>
